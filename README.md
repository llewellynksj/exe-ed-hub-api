# ExeEd Hub - API

ExeEd Hub is a platform for parents to find information and independent reviews of local schools, as well as an online community including discussion boards and an exchanges/forward-recycling forum. Users are able to create a profile, review schools, post and comment on threads, follow other users, and post items they want to find or want to offer to others as part of a forward-recycling initiative.

This repository is the API that serves the live site.

N.B. This is a fictional site populated with dummy data, as part of the final Portfolio Project submission for [Code Institue's]() Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.
